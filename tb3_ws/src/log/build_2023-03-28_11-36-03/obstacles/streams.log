[3.957s] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
[3.958s]   By not providing "Findexample_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
[3.958s]   project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[3.958s]   "example_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.
[3.958s] 
[3.958s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by
[3.958s]   "example_interfaces" with any of the following names:
[3.958s] 
[3.958s]     example_interfacesConfig.cmake
[3.958s]     example_interfaces-config.cmake
[3.958s] 
[3.958s]   Add the installation prefix of "example_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
[3.958s]   set "example_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
[3.958s]   files.  If "example_interfaces" provides a separate development package or
[3.958s]   SDK, be sure it has been installed.
